# 📄 Survey Paper Structure

## Title
- Also including author names and the organizations.
- Clearly conveys the scope, domain, and thematic focus of the survey.  
Should indicate that the paper is a *survey*, *overview*, or *systematic review* of existing work.

## Abstract
Provides a concise overview of the survey’s scope, methodology, and contributions.

**Expected Content:**  
- Problem domain and motivation for the survey  
- Criteria or principles used to organize the literature  
- High-level summary of major categories and trends  
- Intended audience and value of the survey  

## Keywords
- Around 5-7 keywords
- Facilitates indexing, discoverability, and accurate categorization in digital libraries.

**Expected Content:**  
- Core concepts  
- Methodological terms  
- Application domains (if applicable)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation
- Establishes the broader research context and explains why a survey is necessary.

**Expected Content:**  
- Overview of the domain and its evolution  
- Increasing volume or fragmentation of research  
- Practical or theoretical relevance of consolidating prior work  


### 1.2 Objectives and Scope of the Survey

- Defines the intent and boundaries of the survey.

**Expected Content:**  
- Specific goals of the paper  
- Time span, types of studies, or subfields covered  
- Explicit exclusions to manage scope  


### 1.3 Contributions of the Survey
- Clarifies how the survey adds value beyond existing reviews.

**Expected Content:**  
- Novel taxonomy or organizational framework  
- Broader or more up-to-date coverage  
- Unified perspective for newcomers  


### 1.4 Organization of the Paper

- Guides the reader through the structure of the survey.

**Expected Content:**  
- Brief description of each major section  


## 2. Methodology of Literature Collection
- Ensures transparency and reproducibility in how the literature was gathered.

**Expected Content:**  
- Databases and digital libraries consulted  
- Search keywords and query strategies  
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria  
- Screening and selection process  

## 3. Taxonomy and Classification Framework
- Introduces the conceptual structure used to organize the literature.

**Expected Content:**  
- Rationale for the chosen classification scheme  
- Definitions of categories or dimensions  
- Relationship between categories  

This section acts as the backbone of the survey.


## 4. Categorized Review of Existing Literature
- Systematically summarizes prior work according to the defined taxonomy.

**Expected Content:**  
- Subsections corresponding to each category  
- Chronological or thematic grouping within categories  
- Key ideas, methodologies, or perspectives proposed by each group of studies  
- Comparative tables or summary figures (optional but encouraged)  

The focus remains on **descriptive synthesis**, not critique.

## 5. Comparative Overview and Synthesis

- Provides a consolidated view across categories.

**Expected Content:**  
- Cross-category comparisons  
- Summary of dominant approaches and variations  
- Identification of common assumptions or shared frameworks  

This section helps readers see the broader landscape.


## 6. Trends and Research Directions

- Highlights how the field has evolved and where it is heading.

**Expected Content:**  
- Temporal trends in methodologies or applications  
- Emerging themes or shifts in focus  
- Increasing interdisciplinarity or standardization  

This section remains observational rather than speculative.


## 7. Open Problems and Challenges
- Identifies unresolved issues evident from the surveyed literature.

**Expected Content:**  
- Gaps in coverage or underexplored areas  
- Methodological or conceptual limitations commonly reported  
- Practical barriers observed across studies  

Discussion remains grounded in the literature rather than personal opinion.

## 8. Practical Implications and Guidance for New Researchers
- Improves accessibility for newcomers to the field.

**Expected Content:**  
- Recommended entry points into the literature  
- Guidance on selecting subtopics or approaches  
- Suggested benchmarks, datasets, or frameworks commonly used  

## 9. Conclusion
- Summarizes the survey and reinforces its contribution.

**Expected Content:**
