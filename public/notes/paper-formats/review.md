# 📄 Review Paper Structure

## Title
- Also add author names and the organizations.
- Concisely convey the thematic focus and scope of the review. The title should signal synthesis and critical perspective (e.g., “A Review of…”, “Trends and Challenges in…”) rather than reporting new empirical results.

**Content:**  
Clear, neutral, and domain-agnostic phrasing; avoids methodological or dataset-specific claims.


## Abstract  
Provide a high-level, self-contained overview of the review’s motivation, scope, methodology for literature selection, key synthesized insights, and major conclusions.

**Content:**  
- Context and rationale for the review  
- Scope and boundaries of the literature examined  
- Organizational or taxonomic framework adopted  
- Key trends, gaps, and implications  
- Intended audience and contribution  


## Keywords  
- Around 5-7 keywords
- Facilitates indexing, discoverability, and accurate categorization in digital libraries.
- Enhance discoverability and indexing.

**Content:**  
Broad conceptual terms reflecting themes, methods, and perspectives rather than narrow technical details.


## 1. Introduction  
Establish the intellectual context and justify the need for the review.

**Content:**  
- Background and evolution of the research area  
- Motivation for conducting the review (e.g., fragmentation, rapid growth, conflicting findings)  
- Distinction from existing surveys or reviews  
- Clear articulation of the review’s objectives and contributions  
- Outline of the paper’s structure  


## 2. Scope and Review Methodology  
Ensure transparency and rigor in literature selection and synthesis.

**Content:**  
- Criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies  
- Databases, time span, and types of sources considered  
- Screening and filtering strategy  
- Limitations of the review process  

*Note:* This section emphasizes systematic reasoning rather than experimental protocols.


## 3. Conceptual Framework or Taxonomy  
Provide a unifying structure for organizing and interpreting the literature.

**Content:**  
- Definition of core concepts and terminology  
- Development of a classification scheme (e.g., by methodology, assumptions, objectives, or paradigms)  
- Justification for the chosen taxonomy  

The framework introduced here should guide the synthesis throughout the paper.


## 4. Synthesis of Existing Literature  
Integrate prior work into coherent themes rather than listing individual studies.

**Content:**  
- Thematic or category-wise discussion aligned with the proposed taxonomy  
- Comparative analysis across approaches  
- Identification of dominant patterns, consensus, and divergences  
- Evolution of ideas over time  

The emphasis is on relationships, abstractions, and insights.



## 5. Comparative and Critical Analysis  
Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches at a conceptual or methodological level.

**Content:**  
- Comparative discussion across categories or paradigms  
- Trade-offs, assumptions, and constraints  
- Contexts in which certain approaches are effective or limited  
- Cross-cutting challenges identified across the literature  


## 6. Limitations and Open Challenges  
Highlight unresolved issues and structural weaknesses in the body of literature.

**Content:**  
- Methodological, theoretical, or practical limitations  
- Gaps in coverage, evaluation, or generalization  
- Underexplored directions or neglected perspectives  

This section should remain analytical rather than speculative.


## 7. Emerging Trends and Future Research Directions  
Provide informed guidance on how the field is evolving and where future work is needed.

**Content:**  
- Emerging themes or shifts in research focus  
- Promising methodological or conceptual directions  
- Recommendations grounded in identified gaps and trends  

Predictions should be cautious and evidence-based.


## 8. Implications and Broader Impact  
Discuss the significance of the synthesized insights beyond individual studies.

**Content:**  
- Implications for theory, methodology, or practice  
- Relevance to related disciplines or interdisciplinary research  
- How the review advances understanding of the field as a whole  


## 9. Conclusion  
Reinforce the contribution and lasting value of the review.

**Content:**  
- Recap of key synthesized insights  
- Reflection on the review’s scope and limitations  
- Final remarks on the state and trajectory of the field  


## References  
Provide a comprehensive and authoritative bibliographic foundation.

**Content:**  
Well-curated, relevant, and balanced citations, formatted according to the target venue’s guidelines.
